Our rental property was terribly overgrown, and we needed to get the house ready for sale. I explained that we lived out of state and our needs for the property. While on the phone with me, he walked the property verifying what needed to be done, mapping the property lines, and discussing options. He created a cohesive plan for restoring these areas in a detailed contract that was easy to understand with reasonable prices. Communication throughout this project was excellent. He kept me informed of the stages and progress with phone calls, text messages, emails, and pictures. The final results are better than I could have imagined. Randy and his team were excellent. The entire process was seamless and was finished on time. After completion, Randy agreed to take over the general yard maintenance until our house is sold. This offer was very generous as this is not part of his normal services. I would recommend Randy and his team without a moment's hesitation for any landscaping project."

Cheryl Waters,2024-06-17T15:28:15.456Z,2024-06-20T15:56:30.000Z,"Dear Cheryl, 

We are truly sorry to hear that you are upset and dissatisfied with our services. At Randy's Pro Tree Service, we strive to provide excellent customer service and high-quality work. We attempted to address your concerns by returning to fixing the hairline cracks caused by the sealer, which can occur due to weather changes and are common with patchwork as opposed to complete concrete replacement.

We want to emphasize that despite these issues with the sealer, the driveway still came out great. It was thoroughly power-washed clean, and all the gaps were properly cleaned out. The hairline cracks in the sealer are an unfortunate but expected outcome given the weather changes and the nature of patching and sealing work vs full replacement.
We regret that we were unable to meet your expectations. Despite our efforts to resolve the situation, we experienced disrespect, profanities towards us, and verbal intimidation over the phone, making it in everyone's best interest to cease further communication.

It's important to note that our business has received personal praise from over 225 families on the same platform where you are calling our business a “sham”. To anyone reading this review, please know that we really are not a “sham”. We have been in business since 2008 and are fully licensed in the state of New Jersy for both home improvement contracting and tree work. We also carry general liability, business and workers compensation insurance and attend industry education courses each year to stay sharp.

We take great pride in our “4.9” rating and are committed to ensuring customer satisfaction. We always strive to make things right. We sincerely wish you the best.

Sincerely,
Randy's Pro Tree Service

He tried to call back and say send an email I already sent 3 times already!! Why would I need to send another email after countless voice messages and missed calls from myself.

Do NOT give your business or money to this establishment!!! They have the worst customer service. We will not be hiring them to correct their sham work!!!  And I advise the same to you!!

We sincerely apologize for your experience with Randy's Pro Tree Service, and that our business relationship has ended under such circumstances.

Since we began working together in late 2022, our team has aimed to respond promptly to any issues, including your concerns about billing inaccuracies. That particular issue was solved in one email, once it was confirmed this it wasn’t your property.

As for the lawn service, it was necessary to clean up before mowing to prevent the wood debris on the ground from damaging our equipment or affecting the quality of our work. When we could not agree on compensating for this additional cleanup, it seemed best for both parties to part ways.

We regret that you felt our service came across as arrogant or unprofessional. It was never our intent to give that impression. Our contracts are designed to be flexible, allowing any client to discontinue services at their convenience or displeasure, just as we have chosen in this instance.

We are disheartened to hear about your dissatisfaction and take your feedback seriously as we continually strive to improve our service quality. Thank you for your business over the past year, and we wish you the best with your new landscaping service.

Despite his reviews I went with him for 1 year. During that time Randy and his team have broken landscape lamps, (refusing to take ownership even after showing him photos and security footage), sent me wrong bills SEVERAL times, many times i spent my entire day arguing with them that they sent me the wrong bill for over $3000 for the WRONG house. One time they showed me they did work on my house that had a pool when I don't even have a pool. Even after sending them google map satellite photos of my house they continued to argue with me all day wasting my time. I had him trim my hedges and they did such a poor job doing so, I had to call Randy back to correct but he said he doesn't like trim too much even though branches were hitting my living room window. He shows up at my house randomly to address the issue and I wasn't even home or was advised he wanted to speak in person to talk. My lawn looks worse before he took over, the cuts are uneven, their edging work is terrible and they are OVERPRICED! I had several landscapers come to my home to review the work Randy did and were absolutely appalled with the quality of work and what we have paid. Most recently Randy did Spring clean up at my home without my authorization, I NEVER needed Spring clean up before but he decided he was going to charge me for it this year despite no spring clean up being done and in the past he never did it because it wasn't necessary from the fall clean up we did. When I disputed it the charge with their admin, they dropped me as a customer which is ridiculous since I paid Randy on time always and I always communicated with them if I wanted to arrange a payment for later date if the service needed to be performed sooner per his recommendation. So in the one year working Randy, it was the most aggravating unprofessional. Good riddance. Happy to have found another landscaper that prioritizes customer service and quality of work.

Bottom line: save yourself the headache, there are other landscapers in the area that do a better job and have better customer service than Randy and his team."

I have paper sticking out, all my landscape lights were buried in mulch and then there were areas where mulch is missing. They trimmed one tree but not the other. I reached out and emailed what the issues were because I wanted Randy to come see the work his workers did, he never responded. I even emailed pictures and no response. I have given him a month of time to rectify or even respond and I have still not heard back. The only good thing they did was remove a few trees and the lawn cutting is fine.

Randy showed up on time, he listened to what I wanted to do, and gave suggestions along the way. He has a great eye for things and made wonderful suggestions. He went over the materials, answered the gazillion questions I had and made sure we were on the same page. Once the work started he updated me with pictures and calls. Very on top of everything. If there was something additional I wanted or if I wanted something modified he always found time to discuss or to show me different solutions/ideas. His workers are fantastic and extremely just as helpful.

I am extremely happy with the work they have done. I have gotten many compliments about the work he did. I recommend him 100% and would use him again for future projects."

I looked up local landscapers and saw all his reviews and asked if he could come to my new house to look at the disaster the previous owners left. He came and within minutes I knew the type of guy I was dealing with. I said to go nuts and tell me what he would do/suggest and he immediately started identifying issues, rotting trees and started giving suggestions. He’s a perfectionist like myself so we hit it off. He sent the proposal, not the cheapest, but I accepted and the amount of work his team did in 2 days was insane. I did get confused however as after the first day he sent photos and a review request which to me sounds like he was done but I said there is no way on earth he could have been done as there were still lots of things needing finishing. I called him and the second day they did in fact do a ton more work and finished the job. If he didn’t come back to finish I’d leave a 1 star review but he even went out of his way to make sure every area was taken care of and came back to pick up a few things. He is great if you are looking for a higher end service and want to use his expertise. They did a great job and if you are looking for a landscaping makeover he’s your guy!"

Randy picked up the phone immediately when I initially called and came by the next day to provide an estimate for the removal of a large oak. He was super responsive and punctual but he has earned my business for life for his honesty! Instead of providing a estimate for the removal, he told me to contact the town to have it removed for free! None of the other contractors I dealt with informed me that it was the town’s responsibility! The fact that he would tell me exactly what to do and provided pictures to get the town to pay, even though it would cost him a job, demonstrates his concern for his customers. Randy will be the first call I make for all of my future tree or landscape needs."

My friend referred me the company and once I talked Randy, I know this is it. First, Randy and his crew are very punctual, when they give you the time they really mean it which is very important in my case because I need to make a couple arrangements in order to get the service done properly. Second, Randy is very understanding, nice to talk with and willing to answer questions even before we sign a contract. This may not be a big case, but one of the other companies simply decline to answer any questions before a contract is signed which makes Randy’s company a much happier choice for me. Third, Randy’s price quote shines among others,  which made the choice a no brainer work. The final service is also outstanding. The tree is close to a powerline and they planned ahead did careful works not to cause any damage. The afterward clean work is another plus. All woods and debris are cleaned and Carried away, if it is not one tree less, our yard looks like nothing happened. I will definitely hire Randy again when needed."

I called four businesses and asked them for estimate. Two of the businesses did not bother to call me back. One company was twice expensive than Randy’s and I did not hire it.
When I called Randy’s I spoke directly to the owner. He talk to me and listen to my inquiry. He sent my estimate the same day and next day he sent his employee to me and he finessed everything the way he promised.
He is professional and his employees are skillful and treat your property like their own. He charged my 40% less than the other company.

It was only after you were satisfied that you paid the final payment. This is common practice in the design build trade - after a deposit and work is completed, the work is then reviewed by the customer and if they are satisfied, a final payment is made.

NEGATIVE STARS AS IT'LL COST ME TO CORRECT HIS ""WORK"" Pitched patio steeply when we agreed for it to be installed level so I could put a pool on it. Then he did try to make it right and it pitches towards the steps now. The water pools there. Killed a tree while putting in a walkway, now the tree he put in as a replacement last fall isn't growing. Erased an edged gravel walkway while clearing a separate section of yard to plant grass. Removed a drainage pipe and now the water flows across the yard, eroding it. Said ""I'll have someone come Monday"" to put conduit over exposed wiring. I'm theoretically still waiting. Broke a switch on electric panel. I don't want to ever see him again. Just beware. I feel even worse now that I see all the positive reviews. A neighbor down the street stopped using his services as well, even though we'd never spoken about Randy previously. It took around a Month for Randy to reply to any form of communication when I first raised an issue. SAD BEWARE.
Follow up.
I find it hard how I could have inspected beneath i. e. underneath the patio which then caved in after only 2 years."

Randy's team completed all the work and cleaned and removed everything.  They will be back in the spring to do the rest of the trees I would recommend them fir all your tree and landscaping needs.

They also disposed of all the junk left behind by the previous owner.

Separately I have asked for my gutters to be cleaned, a fix for my small front garden, trees cut back or down. Randy’s is super responsive. They have contacted me when they noticed a problem and asked if I wanted help with it. The prices have always been reasonable and I even use them for my weekly lawn/property maintenance.

They do provide the basic services of complete lawn care and expert tree service.   We have numerous species and ages of trees that required significant work — well done.   Beyond this, Randy provides sophisticated advice and planning on grading, patio work, lightning and plantings.   He has a great eye for detail and many of his team are dedicated, long term employees.   Happy to be a reference."
